# 🔬 Micro-Scale Sentinel

**AI-powered microplastic detection for holographic microscopy images**

A simplified, educational Streamlit application for environmental engineering students to classify microscopic particles (100-500μm) using physics-based feature extraction and Google Gemini AI.

## 🎯 What This Does

Micro-Scale Sentinel helps you distinguish **microplastics** from **biological organisms** in holographic microscopy images using physics principles:

- **Refractive Index (RI) Analysis**: Plastics (RI: 1.4-1.6) vs Water/Organisms (RI: 1.33-1.40)
- **Optical Pattern Recognition**: AI analyzes diffraction fringes unique to synthetic materials
- **Morphological Analysis**: Shape irregularity detection (plastics are jagged, organisms are symmetric)

**Perfect for**: Environmental engineering labs, water quality research, materials science education
